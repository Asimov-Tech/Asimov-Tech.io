            <h3>Reinforcement Learning in a robotics application</h3>
            <p> During my bachelor's degree, I undertook a project focused on applying a reinforcement learning algorithm within a robotics context.
                My primary responsibility was to develop this algorithm for an articulated robotic arm, aiming to enable it to grasp a 
                cube as part of a competition hosted by the European Space Agency. The project was a success, and the robot was able to grasp the cube </p>
