forms a tapestry of interwoven destinies. The vivid spectrum of hues—from deep purples and greens to delicate blues and reds—symbolizes the diversity
and harmony found in our shared existence. My intent was to evoke contemplation on the chaotic yet ordered nature of the universe,
inviting viewers to discover the inherent beauty within the abstract intersections of their own lives.
